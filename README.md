# AdvancedSQLPractice
Some advanced practices with subqueries, regex, self-join, window functions, CTEs, procedures

To go through this practice, start off with 'Database Initialization' then:

  -> Warmup exercises
  
  -> Subqueries
  
  -> Regex (Optional)
  
  -> CTEs
  
  -> Derived tables
  
  -> Window functions
  
  -> Procedures
  
  -> Procedures with control flow
  
Enjoy!

<em>Notes: All queries and functions used in this practice are MySQL-based. For those who use SQL Server, you might need to look up for relatively similar functions that are supported in Microsoft SQL Server!</em>
